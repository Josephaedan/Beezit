## Tech Stack

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Setup

### Ensure that you have Node.js, npm and PostgreSQL installed.

If you do not have Node.js installed, it is recommended to install from their site [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). This will install the latest version of Node.js along with npm.

If you do not have PostgreSQL installed, download it [here](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html).

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com/josephaedan/Beezit.git
```

### Install dependencies

1. To install frontend dependencies, `cd` to the /client directory and run
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. To install backend dependencies, `cd` to the /server directory and run
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. To create the PostgreSQL database and table, in the backend /server directory, run the following command in psql
    ```psql
    \i database.sql
    ```
    
    If your default Postgres account is not superuser `postgres`, switch to superuser by running
    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres psql
    ```

## Development

### Start server in development

1. Run Postgres app and start the server on `Port 5432`.

2. Start the local backend server on `Port 3001` by running
    ```bash
    node index
    ```

The server should now be running locally on `localhost:3001`, and the API can be reached via `localhost:3001/beez`.

The backend server must be running before starting the app.

### Start app in development

1. Start the app by running
```bash
npm run start
```

The app should now be running locally on `localhost:3000`.

The website should be now be live and connected with the backend server and database.
